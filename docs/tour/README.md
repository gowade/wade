# Wa.de.Go! The Tour
*Hai Thanh nguyen, July 2014*

This is a quick introduction to [Wade.go](https://github.com/phaikawl/wade) the client-side web framework for Go. It's designed to get you understand basic concepts and the code of Wade's *ez* demo app.

Except for the *Up and running* (installation) section, this is not a (boring?) step-by-step "hands on" tutorial. So hope you will enjoy the breeze.
